/* COMPARATION OPERATORS
we can compare numbers using the following symbols.

> greater than 
< less than
>= greater or equal to
<= less or equal to
= equal to

<> not equal to
!= not equal to 
 the results shown in this type of comparations will be boolean */
 
 
 /* ***** EQUAL TO STATEMENT ***** */
 SELECT 4 = 4; /* we have as a result value "1" so it means the comparation statement is True and in the other case if its 0 means it is false */
 /*1 = afirmativc
 0 = no afirmativo */

 SELECT 4 = 5 ; /* we have as a result "0" so the statement is false */
 
 
 /* ***** GREATER THAN STATEMENT ***** */
 SELECT 5 > 3; /* RESULT = 1 SO IS TRUE */
 
 SELECT 5 < 3; /*RESULT = 0 SO IS FALSE */
 
 
 /* ***** LESS THAN OR GREATER THAN ***** */
 SELECT 5 <= 3; /* ANSWER IS 0 SO IS FALSE */
 
 SELECT 5 >= 3; /* ANSWER IS 1 SO IS TRUE */
 
 
 /* ***** EQUAL TO ***** */
SELECT 5 <> 3; /* ANSWER IS 1 SO IS TRUE */

SELECT 5 <> 5; /* ANSWER IS 0 SO IS FALSE */

 
 /* ***** NOT EQUAL TO ***** */
SELECT 5 != 5; /* ANSWER IS 0 SO IS FALSE */
